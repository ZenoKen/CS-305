1.	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A consulting company called Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for its clients. They engaged us to create their open-source web application and    make it secure enough to handle the delicate financial and personal information contained therein.

2.	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Using static testing, I was successful in locating current vulnerabilities in the code base. Secure coding is crucial to thwart data theft and safeguard the brand's integrity and dependability.

3.	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
By automatically finding vulnerabilities rather than manually examining each dependent for weaknesses, the dependency check tool was beneficial and helped save a lot of time.

4.	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To identify vulnerabilities more accurately, penetration testing should become important in the future.

5.	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Whenever a new dependency was introduced, the dependency check had to be re-run. If not, functionality can be guaranteed by manual code review and unit testing.

6.	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I did a lot of helpful research on the internet about current procedures and algorithms.

7.	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience.
What might you show future employers from this assignment? I would send them an GitHub invite link of the assignments I have completed. By viewing the assignments posted they’ll be able to see my skill, knowledge, and experience.
